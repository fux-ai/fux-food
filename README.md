# Welcome to Fux Food

Fux Food is an open-source boilerplate project built with Next.js 13, designed to kick-start your web development projects and streamline your workflow. It offers a powerful starting point for both professionals and newcomers to the world of React and server-side rendering, while also integrating a well-designed welcome page for email collection.

## About Fux Food

Fux Food leverages the latest version of Next.js, a robust React framework developed by Vercel. The project includes pre-rendering, automatic code splitting, and a serverless function environment, all optimized to deliver top-notch performance.

In addition to the core Next.js features, Fux Food is pre-configured with several popular frameworks and tools to provide a comprehensive development environment. It integrates Tailwind CSS, a highly customizable, low-level CSS framework that allows you to build modern designs with ease. Husky is included to ensure consistent code quality by automatically running tasks like linting and testing before each commit. The project also incorporates Storybook, a powerful tool for developing UI components in isolation, allowing you to build complex, durable, and accessible UIs from simple components.

To ensure consistent coding standards and maintain the quality of the codebase, Fux Food includes a pre-configured lint setup. This means that your code is automatically checked for common errors and deviations from coding standards, leading to more reliable and maintainable software.
